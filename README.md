# Kitab Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** September 2025

Thank you for using Kitab. Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

---

## 1) Information We Collect

**Account Information.** Email, username, and profile details you provide.

**Messages & Media.**
- Direct messages and attachments you send.
- Messages are encrypted in transit and at rest. Where supported, one-to-one messages use end-to-end encryption so only sender and recipient can read them.

**Duplicate-Image Detection Data.**
- To stop spam, when you upload an image we compute a non-reversible fingerprint (perceptual hash) of the image.
- The same image may be uploaded twice; a third attempt is blocked automatically.
- We store the fingerprint and minimal counters needed to enforce this rule. We do not share these fingerprints with third parties.

**Device & Usage Data.**
- App/version, OS, crash logs, diagnostics, and aggregated usage (e.g., feature usage counts).
- We do not use this data for cross-app tracking or advertising.

---

## 2) How We Use Information

- Provide core messaging features and improve performance and reliability.
- Detect and block duplicate images (anti-spam/abuse).
- Troubleshoot, support, and secure the service (fraud/abuse detection, rate-limiting).
- Communicate service notices (e.g., changes to terms, privacy, or incidents).

---

## 3) Permissions We Request (and Why)

- **Camera** ‚Äî We use your camera so you can take and upload photos (e.g., a profile picture or a photo to share in chat).
- **Photo Library** ‚Äî We use your photo library so you can choose images to share in chat or set a profile picture.
- **Photo Library Add** (if you offer ‚ÄúSave to Photos‚Äù) ‚Äî We save photos to your library only when you ask us to download or export media.
- **Notifications (optional)** ‚Äî To alert you about new messages. You can change your decision any time in iOS Settings.

We request each permission only when needed, and you can change or revoke permissions in your device settings.

---

## 4) Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or trade your data. We share data only:

- With service providers who host, store, or process data on our instructions and under contract (e.g., cloud infrastructure, crash analytics).
- For legal compliance when required by law or valid legal process.
- For security to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.

---

## 5) Data Security

We use encryption, access controls, and industry-standard safeguards. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve our protections.

---

## 6) Data Retention

- **Messages & Media:** retained to provide the service (e.g., your chat history) until you delete them or delete your account.
- **Duplicate-Image Fingerprints:** retained as long as necessary to enforce the duplicate-blocking rule and protect the service, and deleted when no longer needed or upon account deletion.
- **Diagnostics:** retained for a limited period to troubleshoot and improve stability.

---

## 7) Your Rights & Choices

- **Delete Account & Data:** Use **Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account** (if available) or contact us (see below).
- **Control Permissions:** Manage Camera/Photos/Notifications in your device settings.
- **Manage Content:** You can delete your own messages and media within the app.

If you are in a region with specific privacy rights (e.g., GDPR/CCPA), you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your data, or object/restrict certain processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.

---

## 8) Children‚Äôs Privacy

Kitab is not directed to children under 13. If we learn we collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete it.

---

## 9) International Transfers

We may process and store data in the United States (and/or other regions where our cloud providers operate). We use approved safeguards for international transfers where required.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this Policy periodically. We‚Äôll update the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date and, when material changes occur, provide additional notice in-app or by email.
