# Kitab Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Last Updated:** September 25, 2025

## 1) Overview
Kitab (“**Kitab**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and the choices you have when using our mobile application (the “**App**”).

By using Kitab, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 2) Scope
This Policy applies to the Kitab App and related customer support channels. It does not apply to third-party websites, apps, or services that we do not control.

## 3) Information We Collect

### a) Information you provide
- **Account Data:** name, email, profile details.  
- **User Content:** messages, photos, videos, text, notes, highlights, and other content you upload, send, or store in the App.  
- **Support Communications:** messages you send to us (including metadata such as time and channel).

### b) Information collected automatically
- **Usage Data:** app interactions, features used, session activity, in-app actions, crash reports, and diagnostics.  
- **Device & Technical Data:** device model, operating system and version, language, time zone, app version, IP address, and identifiers assigned by your device or the App.  
- **Log Data:** timestamps, performance metrics, and error logs.

### c) Information from your device (permissions)
With your consent (per your device settings), the App may access:
- **Camera & Photos/Media/Library:** to capture or select media you choose to share.  
- **Microphone:** to record audio you choose to share.  
- **Push Notifications:** to send updates and messages (you can manage this in device settings).

We do **not** collect content from your device without your action or permission.

## 4) How We Use Your Information
We use information to:
- **Provide the Service:** create and manage accounts, enable core functionality (e.g., content viewing, saving, and sharing), and ensure reliability.  
- **Support & Safety:** respond to inquiries, troubleshoot, detect/prevent misuse, abuse, or security incidents.  
- **Improve & Analyze:** monitor performance, perform analytics, and enhance features and usability.  
- **Communicate:** send service-related notices (e.g., updates, security, changes to policies). Marketing messages are only sent where permitted by law and can be opted out of at any time.

### Legal bases for processing (EEA/UK only)
Where applicable, we rely on: **contract necessity** (to provide the App and support), **legitimate interests** (security, fraud prevention, feature improvement), and **consent** (for optional features like push notifications or media access).

## 5) Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do **not** sell your personal information. We also do **not** “share” it for cross-context behavioral advertising.

We may disclose information:
- **Service Providers:** trusted vendors who host, store, analyze, or support the App under contracts requiring confidentiality and appropriate safeguards.  
- **Legal & Safety:** if required by law, subpoena, or to protect rights, safety, and the integrity of our Service and users.  
- **Business Transfers:** if we undergo a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or asset sale, your information may be transferred consistent with this Policy and applicable law.

## 6) Data Security
We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect personal data (e.g., access controls, encryption in transit, and protections against common threats). However, no method of transmission or storage is fully secure.

## 7) Data Retention
We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Retention periods vary by data type and context (e.g., account data is kept while your account is active; diagnostic logs are kept for a limited period). When no longer needed, we take steps to delete or de-identify data.

## 8) Your Choices & Rights

### In-App Controls
- **Account & Profile:** view and update certain information in the App.  
- **Notifications & Permissions:** manage push notifications, camera, photos, and microphone permissions via device settings.

### Privacy Rights (depending on your location)
You may have rights to **access** and **portability**, **correct**, **delete**, **restrict** or **object** to certain processing, and **withdraw consent** where processing is based on consent.  
We will verify your request and respond within the timeframe required by applicable law. You may authorize an agent to submit requests where permitted.

**How to exercise:** see **Contact Us & Requests** below or use in-app controls where available.

## 9) Account Deletion (Self-Service)
Users may permanently delete their account at any time directly from the **Profile** section within the App. Deletion will permanently remove the user’s account, messages, and media. Once deleted, the account cannot be recovered, and the user will be signed out immediately.  
If you choose to delete your account, all data associated with your account will be permanently removed. You may re-register for a new account using the same email address, but none of your previous account data will be available.

## 10) International Transfers
If we transfer your information across borders, we will use appropriate safeguards (e.g., contractual protections consistent with applicable law) to protect your information.

## 11) Children’s Privacy
Kitab is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to delete it.

## 12) Third-Party Services & Links
The App may link to or integrate third-party sites, SDKs, or services. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies. We encourage you to review them.

## 13) Do Not Track & Opt-Out Signals
Your browser or device may offer “Do Not Track” or similar signals. We currently do not respond to these signals. Where legally required (e.g., certain U.S. states), we will honor applicable opt-out mechanisms provided by law.

## 14) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new “Last Updated” date. Material changes will be communicated as required by law.
